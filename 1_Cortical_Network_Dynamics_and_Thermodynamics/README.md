In this work, we investigate the dynamics of cognitive processes emerging from complex interactions within cortical networks. Our findings reveal significant relationships between functional and structural properties, such as the energy-stability-flexibility trade-off and differences in time scales, which align with experimental observations and evolutionary trends. Additionally, this research bridges neurobiology with underlying mechanisms in statistical physics. The theoretical framework developed here is broadly applicable, offering insights into a wide range of biological systems.

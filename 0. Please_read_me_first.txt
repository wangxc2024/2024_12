Hi Farzaneh, 

Here are a few files showcasing my coding work and a brief introduction to them:

1. Code for my second paper

This code was used for computation and analysis in my second paper: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.17206. The code is written in Matlab. 

It mainly focuses on simulation with ordinary differential equations, function optimization based on first-principle (similar to a training process of deep learning), statistical computaion, and visualization.

2. MEG data analysis with MNE toolbox

This is part of code I wrote for analyzing the MEG data when I was in Vancouver last year, using the MNE toolbox in Python. 

3. Machine Learning and Python

This is the project I conducted for the "Machine Learning and Python" course. I made a program for image identification and classification, using CNN to identify the characteristics. 

Prof. Fengfeng Zhou is the teacher of this course (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FL2GqPcAAAAJ&hl=en). He has written a recommendation letter for me. But I didn't ask him to submit his letter at GT. 

Let me know if you have any questions. I'm looking forward to talking more with you!

Best, 
Xiaochen

# Welcome to My Code Repository!

Hello! This repository contains my coding projects, starting from my undergraduate years. It's just the beginning, and I plan to upload more code, add reference sources, and improve the documentation to make it more readable over time. 
It is still not easy to understand at this stage. So feel free to contact me at: wangxc1120@mails.jlu.edu.cn.

## 1. Cortical Network Dynamics and Thermodynamics

This code was used for computation and analysis in my second paper: [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.17206](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2411.17206). The code is written in MATLAB.

The main focus is on simulations using ordinary differential equations, function optimization based on first principles (similar to the training process in deep learning), statistical computation, and visualization.

## 2. MEG Data Analysis with MNE Toolbox

This is part of code I wrote for analyzing the MEG data when I was in Vancouver last year, using the MNE toolbox in Python.

## 3. Image Identification and Classification

This is the project I conducted for the "Machine Learning and Python" course. I created a program for image identification and classification, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify key features.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you!
